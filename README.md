👋 Hi, I'm Mehdi Adel Achouba

🎓 I hold an MBA in Audit, Consulting, and Management Control (Master's degree), with 4 years of experience in management control. I've worked on implementing financial KPIs using SQL databases, digitizing invoice processing, and managing the merger and acquisition of a mid-sized company.

💻 Currently, I'm a student at 42, where I'm enhancing my skills in C, C++, SQL, and Excel. My recent projects include:

    so_long: A 2D video game.
    minishell: A program that launches a mini-shell with bash commands.
    philosophers: A project focused on threads.

📊 Passionate about Python, Data Science, AI, and quantum computing, I'm looking to combine these interests with my background in management control.

🌍 Goal: To secure an internship in the data field, ideally abroad, to improve my English.

🎮 Hobbies: Video games, weightlifting, electronic music, coding, new technologies, and history.
